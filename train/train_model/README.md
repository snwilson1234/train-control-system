## Notes
Slots = receiver of signals
Signals = notifications emitted by widgets when something happens
signals do not have to be initiated by user actions

# Train Model Notes
If the velocity ever dips negative, controller shall apply ebrake. In manual mode, driver would apply ebrake. 
This covers the case of the controller applying normal brakes to slow the train down if it starts rolling back hill. theres no point - would ebrake anyway.
